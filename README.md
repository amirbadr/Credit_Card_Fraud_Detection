# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
In this project, we are predicting if a transaction is a fraud or legal by providing an end-to-end binary classification.<br>
The project was started by some data explanatory analysis such as profiling, data cleansing, data transformation, principal component analysis, <br>
Following by data modeling such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine technique, Random Forest, and XGBoost via parameter tuning with Random Grid Search Cross Validation method. <br>
Various charts and evaluation metrics are used to compare results such as Confusion Mtrix, ROC curve, Precision-Recall curve, Gain and lift chart, and K-S Statistics.
